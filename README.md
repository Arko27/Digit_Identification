# Digit_Identification
<br> Here a Logistic Regression Model has been made for the dataset of **load-digits** from **sklearn.datasets** to predict a digit based on the **load_digits.data** parameter.
<br> **load_digits.images** gave graphical representation of the digits using **matplotlib.pyplot**
<br> In this model, train-test-split from sklearn.model-selection has been imported to train and test the model.
<br> A "Confusion Matrix" has been plotted to visualize the Predicted v/s Truth Value.
<br> The score of the model was found to be 95.33%.
